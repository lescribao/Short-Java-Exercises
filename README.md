# Short-Java-Exercises
A collection of short Java exercises I've done in order to practice and improve


<h2> Integer to Roman </h2> 
<p> https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman </p>
In this short exercise, given a short int number, we have to transform it into a String output in Roman numbers


<h2> Generate Parenthesis Pairs </h2>
<p> https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/ </p>
In this short exercise, given an int number that equals the amount of pairs of parenthesis, return all combinations of well formed parenthesis.


<h2> Container With Most Water </h2>
<p> https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/ </p> 
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

<h2> Two Sum II </h2>
<p> https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/ </p>
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
Your solution must use only constant extra space.
